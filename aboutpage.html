        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Jef Raskin and Bill Atkinson, Apple Inc. has been a pioneer in personal computing. In 1984, we revolutionized the industry with the introduction of the Macintosh, a user-friendly computer featuring a graphical interface, icons, and a mouseâ€”transforming personal computing forever.</p>
        <p>The original Macintosh 128K, introduced on January 24, 1984, featured a 9-inch monochrome display and 128 KB of RAM. It was designed to be accessible to everyday users, not just experts and the first computer to use a graphical user interface and a mouse.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the Macintosh line has evolved, introducing models like the Macintosh 512K and Macintosh Plus, each bringing innovations that set new standards in the industry. </p>
        <p>Today, the Macintosh remains a testament to our commitment to innovation, design, and user-friendly technology, continuing to influence the computing world and Macs are currently sold with Apple's UNIX based macOS operating system.</p>
